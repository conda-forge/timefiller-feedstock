  summary: A package for imputing missing data in time series
  description: timefiller is a Python package for time series imputation and forecasting. When applied to a set of correlated time series, each series is processed individually, leveraging correlations with the other series as well as its own auto-regressive patterns. The package is designed to be easy to use, even for non-experts.
